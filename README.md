# CasinoRoyale

# Using: JavaFX, Scene Builder and CSS. 
This is a Java MVC app that utalizes JavaFx and Scene Builder to provide a multitude of playable and loved Casino games.

Casino Royale aims to provide the user with the most loved casino and sports betting games. This app serves the user by sheltering real world money, meaning the currency earned or lost in this program has ZERO real world value. Hosted on Firebase, users will have a chance to beat the house with a predefined amount of starting funds. Users must play strategically to win, or they may run out of funds, just like in a real world situation. Additional money can be added if the user wishes to add more. 
	(Optional) Casino Royale will be free to play, but using our sports section for real-world bets, using odds.api, is strictly for the love of strategy and chance. 

	The creators of Casino Royale hold no accountability for any user’s real-world money, bets, or strategies. Casino Royale holds no license, nor does it hold the ability for users to deposit or withdraw any real-word currency. 
# 1.   World assumptions
Assume that the user knows the money being used is not real currency (cannot be exchanged and used in the real world)
Assume that users creating accounts and inputting birthdays are not faking birth year, (all users with an account will be assumed to be the legal gambling age)
# 2.   User requirements
Java 19 or later SDK
Internet access
# 3.   Specifications (and interface needs)

Cannot play games until an account has been created
Once an account is created a user can pick a game

Users can then play any of the games listed on the application betting the money they’ve “deposited” and watching it grow or shrink in real time depending on their wins and losses
# 4.   Program and hardware
